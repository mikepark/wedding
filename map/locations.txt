It needs to illustrate the locations of Renaissance Court, Baker Hall Terrace/Baker Hall, Parking Lot and Rotunda relative to each other, and to make clear the walking route and tram delivery points.

Ultimately, this map will be printed (single color) on the back of a directions card insert to the invitation.
I expect it will be thermography printed in slate gray ink. I'd like it to look hand-drawn, but it's totally cool if you make it to scale. Font tbd, but probably futuro.
